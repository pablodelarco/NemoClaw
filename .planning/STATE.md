# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-24)

**Core value:** One-click deployment of NemoClaw on OpenNebula with GPU passthrough and secure defaults
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — appliance-lifecycle-script

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from requirement dependencies (code -> build -> validate -> package)
- [Roadmap]: GPU detection logic (GPU-02, GPU-04) assigned to Phase 1 (appliance script), GPU template/validation (GPU-01, GPU-03) to Phase 3
- [Roadmap]: MKT-04, MKT-08, MKT-10 assigned to Phase 2 (build infrastructure) rather than Phase 4 (marketplace packaging)
- [Phase 01]: Used variable expansion for nvidia driver branch and nodejs version in appliance.sh for maintainability

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Build host (100.123.42.13) not validated for KVM, RAM, disk, GPU availability -- must confirm before Phase 3
- NemoClaw non-interactive install hack (sed workaround) is fragile -- check for --headless flag before implementing in Phase 1
